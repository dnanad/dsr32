    "## Trees: Ensemble Methods - Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is another ensemble technique to create a collection of predictors. In this technique, learners are learned sequentially with early learners fitting simple models to the data and then analyzing data for errors. In other words, we fit consecutive trees (random sample) at every step,and the goal is to solve for net error from the prior tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an input is misclassified by a hypothesis, its weight is increased so that next hypothesis is more likely to classify it correctly. By combining the whole set at the end converts weak learners into a better performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ensemble of trees are built one by one and individual trees are summed sequentially. The Next tree tries to recover the loss (difference between actual and predicted values) from the previous tree.\n",

    "#### Adaboost = Adaptive Boosting\n",
    "AdaBoost learns from the mistakes by increasing the weight of misclassified data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called Adaptive Boosting as the weights are re-assigned to each instance, with higher weights to incorrectly classified instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Adaboost usually has just a node and two leaves.(A tree with one node and two leaves is called a stump)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "<li> 0: Initialize the weights of data points. (e.g. data has 1000 points, each initial point would have 1/1000 = 0.001) </li>\n",
    "<li> 1: Train a decision Tree (whole dataset) </li>\n",
    "<li> 2: Calculate the weighted error rate (e) of the decision tree. </li>\n",
    "<li> 3: Calculate this decision tree’s weight in the ensemble. The weight of this tree = learning rate * log( (1 — e) / e) </li> \n",
    "<br> ** The higher the weighted error of the tree, the less decision power the tree will be given during the later voting. </br>\n",
    "<br> ** The lower the weighted error of the tree, the higher decision power the tree will be given during the later voting. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> 4: Update weights of wrongly classified points. </li> \n",
    "<br> the weight of each data point stays same if the model got this data points correct.</br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor. However, instead of changing the weights for every incorrect classified observation at every iteration like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor.\n",

    "Say we have mean squared error (MSE) as loss defined as:\n",
    "![Mean squared error](./images/xgb_1.png)\n",

    "We want our predictions, such that our loss function (MSE) is minimum. By using gradient descent and updating our predictions based on a learning rate, we can find the values where MSE is minimum.\n",
    "![gradient boosting](./images/xgb_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are basically updating the predictions such that the sum of our residuals is close to 0 (or minimum) and predicted values are sufficiently close to actual values.\n",
